# Summer Internship 2024
## Courses from IBM AI Engineer Program
As part of my internship, I completed six courses from the IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate Program. These courses significantly contributed to my knowledge and skills, which I applied directly in my projects. Here's a brief overview of each course and its relevance:
1. Machine Learning with Python
- Throughout this course, I gained a strong foundation in **Machine Learning (ML)**, exploring various algorithms and techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering. I applied these concepts in a hands-on final project, which helped solidify my understanding of real-world ML applications.
2. Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
- During this course, I gained in-depth knowledge of **Deep Learning**, including core concepts such as **Neurons**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, and techniques like **Gradient Descent**, **Backpropagation**, and **Activation Functions**. I worked hands-on with **Keras** to perform classification and regression tasks, while also exploring advanced architectures like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for real-world applications.
3. Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing
- Throughout this course, I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in **Computer Vision**, exploring key topics such as **image processing**, **pixel transformation**, and real-world applications. I worked with **OpenCV** and the **Pillow library** for image manipulation and learned techniques like **image classification** using **KNN**, **SVM**, and **CNN architectures**, as well as **object detection** with Haar classifiers.
4. Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch
- Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with **PyTorch**, working with **tensors**, **differentiation**, and implementing models like **linear** and **logistic regression**. I explored key techniques such as **gradient descent**, **optimization**, and built **deep neural networks** using **backpropagation**, **dropout**, and **batch normalization**, alongside practical work with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **TorchVision models** for advanced applications.
5. Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow
- Throughout this journey, I gained a deep understanding of TensorFlow and its applications, including linear regression, logistic regression, and convolutional neural networks (CNN). I also delved into both supervised and unsupervised deep learning with TensorFlow. The course included numerous hands-on labs, which provided practical experience and solidified my understanding of these concepts. 
6. AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
- I applied all the knowledge gained from previous courses,
